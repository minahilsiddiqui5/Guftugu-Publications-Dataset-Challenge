# Guftugu-Publications-Dataset-Challenge

The primary focus of this dataset was on cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), as extracting insights was challenging due to numerous data inaccuracies. I meticulously addressed each issue to facilitate easy comprehension of the data.

The analysis of this dataset encompassed several key areas:

- Most demanded books
- Most demanded books in top cities
- Distribution of order statuses
- Monthly count of order statuses
- Annual count of order statuses
- Daily count of order statuses
